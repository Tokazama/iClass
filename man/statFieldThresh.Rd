\description{
A statistical threshold level is determined using the estimated p-value \code{pval} 
given the provided parameters. "cRFT" and "pRFT" specify the method of estimation 
should use RFT cluster and peak statistic estimates respectively.

In addition to RFT based thresholds the user may choose to utilize false-discovery rate
(FDR) based thresholds. These use a primary p-value threshold (default \code{pp = .001})
to create suprathreshold clusters which in turn are used to determine a final threshold
(utilizing \code{pval} at this point). If the estimated peak-FDR statistic is used ("pFDR")
then all suprathreshold voxels are FDR corrected to determine the threshold. If the 
estimated cluster-FDR statistic is used then the cluster maxima are FDR corrected in order
to determine the threshold. 

It is important that the user recognize that when statistical analyses are computed
using RFT that the threshold level plays a role in predicting the p-value. This is 
because the probability of obtaining results is weighted against the probability of 
any occurence given the threshold. For example, if two clusters where exactly the
same but had one was obtained using a lower threshold it would have a lower p-value. 
This has been shown with a power analysis using similar parameters to those presented
herein with the additional variable of signal characteristics to demonstrate the effect 
of image modality on analysis (Friston et al., 1996). Therefore, parameters should be 
chosen according to the type of analysis being performed (fMRI, PET, or VBM) and the 
hypothesis being tested. Due to widely varying oppinions on appropriate thresholding
procedures no specific recommendations are made here. This function simply facilitates
the use of several approaches that users may utilize after consulting available literature.
